//This assignment is important because we need to understand syntax problems since they can prevent a program from running correctly.         //
//These mistakes happens when we don't follow the rules of the computer language, which results in a failure. To guarantee the desired        //
//program performance and save time and effort during the development process, we must identify and repair these problems. also, regular      //
//exposure to syntax problems and the solutions that follow is essential for developing an understanding of the best practices and structure  //
//of the language, which in turn improves productivity and effectiveness as a programmer. Syntax expertise lowers errors and improves the     //
//code's general quality and dependability. All in all this assignment is to help you understand the layout of java and know a little bit of  //
//the language system.                                                                                                                        //
